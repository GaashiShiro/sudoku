you could maybe do a short animation                                                    |
when you click a number and it turns the matching numbers to bold                       |
you could make it zoom in                                                               |
rather than abruptly changing to bold                                                   |
it should be a subtle effect                                                            |
you can try it by making all the tiles have "transition: font-size 300ms"               |       Done
and ofc play around with the transition duration, 300ms is quite fast                   |

"you lost" is barely readable

Make a demo or tutorial (you need to add some hints on how to play the game)

also it begs for more feedback
it doesn't have to be flashy, but some small reactions to clicks etc. is needed

the sfx already gives a good clue
but visuals would definitely boost the experience


Clicking numbers generated shouldn't give error, only if the number was placed by the user

Timer                   | Added but WiP

Game Difficulty (easy, medium, hard and extreme for leaderboard?)

Levels for all game modes, and have fast-pencil
so they would gain that by watching ads or playing games
and that would speed up the leaderboard/ extreme mode
