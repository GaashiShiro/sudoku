you could maybe do a short animation
when you click a number and it turns the matching numbers to bold
you could make it zoom in
rather than abruptly changing to bold
it should be a subtle effect
you can try it by making all the tiles have "transition: font-size 300ms"
and ofc play around with the transition duration, 300ms is quite fast

"you lost" is barely readable
you need to add some hints on how to play the game
or make a demo
or tutorial

and when i hit play again it hangs
on empty screen
that kind of little tweaking
also it begs for more feedback
it doesn't have to be flashy, but some small reactions to clicks etc. is needed

the sfx already gives a good clue
but visuals would definitely boost the experience
